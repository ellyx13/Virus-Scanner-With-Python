# Virus-Scanner-With-Python

This is a simple Python Virus scanner using Virus Total API and PySimpleGUI interface. You can use it to scan suspicious files in the system. In this version, it can only scan 1 file at a time, you can also customize the code to have it scan the whole folder or use the CLI interface. VirusTotal's free API limits 4 requests per minute and 500 requests per day. I think this is enough for you to discover.
